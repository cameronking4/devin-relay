Relay v0.2.0 brings a complete rebrand and configuration overhaul.

### Changes

- **Rebrand to Relay** — All project references, creator attribution, page titles, and descriptions updated
- **Environment variables** — Renamed and simplified for clearer configuration (`RELAY_*` where applicable)
- **Installation docs** — Updated getting-started guide and setup instructions
- **Support and contact** — Revised GitHub links and support contact information across the app
- **Worker runtime** — `dotenv` moved to dependencies for production worker builds
- **Env validation** — Worker only requires `DATABASE_URL`, `REDIS_URL`, and `RELAY_ENCRYPTION_KEY`; full validation skipped for worker process
- **CI** — Allow pnpm install to proceed when lockfile is out of sync (Render CI)
- **Package manager** — pnpm lockfile and `.gitignore` adjustments for lockfile handling
