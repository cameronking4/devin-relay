The **Production Signals Library** is a standalone app that lets you test Relay with production-style webhook payloads without configuring real integrations. Use it to validate triggers, try different event types, and debug payload paths before connecting Sentry, Vercel, GitHub, or other services.

**URL:** [https://devin-relay-testing.vercel.app](https://devin-relay-testing.vercel.app)

## What it does

- **18 services** — Sentry, Vercel, Prometheus, Datadog, Grafana, PagerDuty, GitHub, Vanta, CrowdStrike Falcon, Linear, PostHog, Logflare, OpenTelemetry, Azure Monitor, Azure DevOps, Typeform, AWS CloudWatch, Dynatrace.
- **95+ events** — Each service has multiple event types (e.g. Sentry issue alert, deployment error, GitHub push, PagerDuty incident triggered). Mock payloads follow official docs where applicable.
- **Your webhook URL** — You paste your Relay trigger URL; the library stores it in localStorage and sends POST requests to it when you fire an event.
- **Response log** — You see the HTTP response from Relay (e.g. `200` and `eventId`) so you can confirm delivery and then check **Executions** in Relay.

## How to use

### Step 1 — Webhook URL

1. In Relay, open your project and go to **Triggers**.
2. Create a trigger (or open an existing one) and copy its **Webhook URL**: `https://your-relay-domain/api/webhook/custom/{triggerId}`.
3. Open [devin-relay-testing.vercel.app](https://devin-relay-testing.vercel.app).
4. In **Step 1**, paste your webhook URL. The app saves it in your browser (localStorage) for the next visit.

### Step 2 — Pick a service

Choose one of the 18 services (e.g. Sentry, Vercel, GitHub). The library shows the events available for that service.

### Step 3 — Fire events

1. Select an event type (e.g. "Deployment Error" for Vercel, "Issue Alert Triggered" for Sentry).
2. Click to send the event. The library POSTs the mock payload to your webhook URL with `Content-Type: application/json` and sets `X-Relay-Delivery-Id` for idempotency.
3. Check the response in the app (status and body).
4. In Relay, go to **Executions** for that project to see the run (and the rendered prompt, Devin output, etc.).

## Details

- **Payload format** — Mock payloads are designed to match or resemble real webhook payloads from each service, so conditions and prompt templates that use paths like `payload.event.message` or `payload.repository.name` work as expected.
- **Same endpoint** — The library calls the same `POST /api/webhook/custom/{triggerId}` endpoint that real integrations use. See [Webhook API](/docs/reference/webhook-api) for the full reference.
- **No auth** — The library does not store or send any auth tokens; it only sends the JSON body and standard headers. Your Relay app’s trigger ID in the URL is the only identifier.
