Relay v0.4.0 introduces low noise mode, giving teams fine-grained control over how triggers behave under high event volume.

### Features

- **Low noise mode toggle** — Enable per-trigger to collapse multiple events into a single-branch workflow instead of spawning parallel branches
- **Serialized executions** — When low noise mode is active, executions for the same trigger run sequentially to avoid conflicts
- **Branch naming conventions** — Prompt rendering updated to reflect low noise mode branch strategy
- **Trigger form and wizard** — New toggle and settings exposed in both the create and edit trigger flows

### Technical

- New Drizzle migration adding `lowNoiseMode` attribute to the trigger schema
- Backend processor updated to serialize execution queuing per trigger when low noise mode is enabled
- Context builder and template engine updated to support low noise mode branch naming
