- **Prompt configuration** — Improved prompt editor with better preview and low noise branch-naming support
- **Project dialog and header** — Refreshed create/edit project dialog and streamlined header actions

### Webhook & processing

- **POST body handling** — Stricter validation and improved parsing of incoming webhook payloads
- **Mock demo refresh** — New service labels, additional event types, and updated styling in the webhook test tool

### Technical
