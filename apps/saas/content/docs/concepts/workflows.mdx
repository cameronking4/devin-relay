**Workflows** let you run Devin when a combination of events from **multiple triggers** happens within a **time window**. For example: "When we get a Sentry error **and** a Vercel deployment failure in the same 15 minutes, run Devin once with both contexts."

## How workflows work

1. **Triggers** — You select one or more triggers that feed the workflow (e.g. Sentry alerts + Vercel deployment events).

2. **Time window** — You set a window in minutes. When a new event arrives for any of those triggers, Relay looks back over that window for **unconsumed** events from the workflow's triggers.

3. **Match mode** — You choose:
   - **Any** — At least one of the selected triggers has at least one event in the window.
   - **All** — Every selected trigger has at least one event in the window.

4. **Optional conditions** — You can add workflow-level conditions on the events (e.g. filter by payload path/operator/value). Only events that pass these conditions count toward the match.

5. **Execution** — When the match is satisfied, Relay enqueues **one** workflow execution job. The prompt receives a **batch payload**: events grouped by source (trigger), with optional summary and window metadata. Devin sees all relevant events in one run.

6. **Consumed** — The events used for that workflow run are marked consumed for the workflow so they don't trigger the same workflow again.

## Creating a workflow

From the project's **Triggers** page, use **Event workflows** and **Create workflow**. You'll set:

- **Name** — For your own reference.
- **Triggers** — Check the triggers that should feed this workflow.
- **Match mode** — Any or All.
- **Time window (minutes)** — How far back to look when an event arrives.
- **Conditions** — Optional filters on payloads.
- **Prompt template** — The instruction for Devin; you can use the batch payload (e.g. `{{payload.sources}}`, `{{payload.summary}}`).
- **GitHub repository** — The repo Devin will work in.

## When to use workflows

- **Correlation** — Run Devin when multiple signals occur together (e.g. error + deployment, or issue + comment).
- **Batching** — Avoid running Devin on every single event; wait until "any" or "all" triggers have fired in the window, then run once with full context.
- **Reducing noise** — Combine with threshold-like behavior by using "all" and a short window so Devin runs only when several things have happened.
