Relay v0.4.0 expands the webhook mock demo, adds project-level stats, and hardens webhook ingestion.

### Features

- **Expanded mock demo** — Added GitHub, Stripe, Supabase, and Linear event types with service labels for clearer UI; new payload generators for Datadog, PagerDuty, and restructured Grafana/Prometheus multi-alert payloads
- **Project overview stats** — Aggregate metrics displayed on the projects page with a dedicated stats component and activity chart
- **Devin session links** — Execution detail view, summary, and table now link directly to the corresponding Devin session
- **Prompt preview improvements** — Sample payload support for realistic previews, embedded single-preview mode, and suggested paths from recent events in the prompt editor
- **Webhook POST validation** — JSON and URL-encoded body parsing, empty/oversized payload checks, and consistent delivery-ID hashing

### UI and cleanup

- Project dialog and header actions redesigned for consistent spacing
- Footer links and support contacts updated for Relay branding
- Obsolete starterkit trigger components removed to streamline the codebase
