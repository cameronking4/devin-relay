Before connecting a real integration (Sentry, Vercel, GitHub, etc.), you can validate that your trigger accepts payloads and runs executions as expected. Relay provides two main options.

## In-app Test webhook block

On the **trigger detail page** in Relay, use the **Test webhook** block.

1. Open your project → **Triggers** → select the trigger.
2. Find the **Test webhook** section.
3. Paste or type a JSON payload (e.g. a minimal `{ "message": "Test" }` or a full sample matching your integration).
4. Send the request. You'll see the HTTP response (status and body).
5. Go to **Executions** for the project to see the run (pending → running → completed/failed) and inspect the rendered prompt and Devin output.

This is ideal for quick one-off tests and for payloads you craft yourself (e.g. to test conditions or template variables).

## Production Signals Library

The [Production Signals Library](https://devin-relay-testing.vercel.app) lets you fire **production-style mock events** without configuring real services.

1. Copy your trigger's webhook URL from Relay.
2. Open [devin-relay-testing.vercel.app](https://devin-relay-testing.vercel.app) and paste the URL (Step 1). The app stores it in your browser.
3. Pick a **service** (e.g. Sentry, Vercel, GitHub) and an **event type** (e.g. "Deployment Error", "Issue Alert Triggered").
4. Fire the event. The library POSTs the mock payload to your trigger and shows the response.
5. In Relay, check **Executions** to see the run and verify prompt rendering and Devin behavior.

Mock payloads follow or resemble official docs for each service, so paths like `payload.event.message` or `payload.repository.name` work as they would with real webhooks. See [Production Signals Library](/docs/guides/production-signals-library) for the full list of services and events.

## Recommended flow

1. **Create** the trigger (name, prompt template, repo, optional advanced settings).
2. **Test** with the in-app block or the Signals Library to confirm the payload is accepted and an execution is created.
3. **Inspect** the execution (rendered prompt, output, errors) and adjust the template or conditions as needed.
4. **Connect** the real integration using the same webhook URL (see [Integrations](/docs/guides/integrations)).
