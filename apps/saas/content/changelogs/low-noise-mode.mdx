Relay v0.4.0 brings low noise mode for triggers, a richer project dashboard, and several webhook and UI improvements.

### Features

- **Low noise mode** — Enable per-trigger to collapse high-frequency events into a single-branch workflow with serialized executions
- **Project overview stats** — Aggregate execution counts, activity chart, and Devin sessions sheet on the project page
- **Devin session links** — Direct links to Devin sessions from execution detail views, summaries, and the executions table
- **Prompt configuration** — Improved prompt editor, preview rendering, and recent-payload inspector for trigger setup
- **Webhook mock demo** — New service payloads for GitHub, Linear, Stripe, Supabase, and Datadog; refined UI with service grid, event list, and response log components

### Improvements

- **Webhook POST handling** — Stricter body parsing and validation for custom webhook endpoints
- **Project dialog** — Updated create-project dialog and header actions
- **Repo tree picker** — Expanded dialog for browsing and selecting repository paths
- **Footer and support links** — Revised footer layout and support contact references

### Technical

- New Drizzle migration adding `lowNoiseMode` to the trigger schema
- Backend processor serializes execution queuing when low noise mode is active
- Context builder and template engine updated for low noise mode branch naming
- Webhook mock demo restructured with per-service payload modules and shared component library
