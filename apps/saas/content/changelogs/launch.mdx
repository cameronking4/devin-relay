Relay is the AI control plane for platform and DevEx teams. Connect a webhook, trigger Devin, and route outputs to GitHub—without maintaining glue code.

### Features

- **Projects and triggers** — Create projects and configure webhook-triggered workflows from a single dashboard
- **Generic webhooks** — Unique URL per trigger, JSON POST ingestion, optional HMAC, schema introspection
- **BYOK Devin** — Your API key, encrypted at rest, never logged
- **Condition builder** — Filter events by payload paths before invoking Devin
- **Execution visibility** — Raw payload, rendered prompt, Devin output, latency, and errors for every run
- **Webhook mock demo** — Test triggers with Datadog, Grafana, PagerDuty, Prometheus, Sentry, and Vercel-style payloads

### Stack

Next.js (App Router), TypeScript, PostgreSQL (Drizzle), Redis (BullMQ), Devin, GitHub App, Vercel + worker for background jobs.
