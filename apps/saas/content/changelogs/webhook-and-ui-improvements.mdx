Relay v0.4.0 brings webhook reliability improvements, a richer mock demo, and a revamped project dashboard.

### Features

- **Project overview stats** — Aggregate metrics across all projects displayed on the main project page with a dedicated stats component and activity chart
- **Project cards** — Redesigned project list with dedicated cards, edit dialogs, and improved empty-state guidance
- **Devin session links** — Direct links to open Devin sessions from execution detail views, summaries, and the executions table
- **Header actions** — Configurable header actions on project and page-shell layouts for quick access to create flows

### Webhook improvements

- **POST body processing** — Robust parsing for JSON and URL-encoded formats with validation for empty or missing payloads
- **Payload size limits** — Requests exceeding the maximum payload size now return clear errors
- **Consistent delivery IDs** — Payload hashing uses the processed raw body for reliable deduplication

### Mock demo expansion

- **New service labels** — Human-readable service names throughout the demo UI
- **Additional event types** — GitHub, Stripe, Supabase, and Linear events added alongside expanded Datadog, Grafana, PagerDuty, Sentry, and Vercel payloads
- **Multi-alert scenarios** — Grafana and Prometheus payloads now support multi-alert structures

### Housekeeping

- Removed obsolete trigger components and starterkit webhook-mock-demo directory
- Updated footer links and support contact information to match Relay branding
