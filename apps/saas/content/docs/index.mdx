Relay is **event-driven AI orchestration for engineering signals.** Modern dev tools emit webhooks; AI systems reason—but don't natively integrate with those signals. Relay closes the loop.

**Connect a webhook. Trigger Devin. Route outputs to GitHub. Zero glue code.**

## What Relay delivers

- **Native GitHub integration** — `pull_request.opened`, `pull_request.synchronize`, `issue_comment.created`, and more.
- **Generic webhooks** — JSON POST, unique URL per trigger, optional idempotency headers, schema introspection.
- **BYOK Devin** — your API key, encrypted at rest, never logged.
- **Full visibility** — raw payload, rendered prompt, Devin output, latency, and errors for every execution.

Not a chatbot. Not a PR bot. Not a Zapier clone. **Relay is the beginning of an AI control plane.**

## Who it's for

- **Platform engineers** shipping internal tooling
- **DevEx teams** automating code review and feedback loops
- **AI-forward startups** (10–200 engineers) experimenting with automation

If you use GitHub and modern SaaS tooling—and you'd rather not maintain glue code—Relay is built for you.
