description: "Set up Sentry, Vercel, GitHub, or any custom service to send webhooks to Relay. Setup steps and example payloads."
---

Relay accepts webhooks from any service that can send HTTP POST requests. This guide covers setup for common integrations and how to use payload paths in conditions and prompt templates.

## Webhook URL

Use your trigger's webhook URL in the integration:

```
https://your-relay-domain/api/webhook/custom/{triggerId}
```

Get the URL from the trigger detail page in Relay (Webhook setup step or Webhook URL card). For full API details see [Webhook API](/docs/reference/webhook-api).

---

## Sentry

**Use case:** Send Sentry error alerts to trigger Devin (e.g. auto-investigate or create issues).

### Setup

1. Go to your Sentry project **Settings**.
2. Navigate to **Alerts** → **Alert Rules**.
3. Create a new alert rule.
4. Set the action to **Send a webhook**.
5. Use your Relay trigger URL as the webhook URL.
6. Configure the payload format as needed (Sentry may offer a default; you can customize to match the example below if desired).

### Example payload

Use paths like `payload.event.message`, `payload.event.level`, `payload.project.name` in conditions and templates.

```json
{
  "event": {
    "id": "abc123",
    "message": "Error: Cannot read property 'x' of undefined",
    "level": "error",
    "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
  },
  "project": {
    "name": "my-app",
    "slug": "my-app"
  },
  "url": "https://sentry.io/organizations/org/issues/123/"
}
```

---

## Vercel

**Use case:** Trigger Devin on deployment events (e.g. on deployment failure or success).

### Setup

1. Go to your Vercel **Project settings**.
2. Navigate to **Integrations** → **Webhooks**.
3. Click **Create Webhook**.
4. Select events (e.g. **Deployment Created**, **Deployment Failed**).
5. Use your Relay trigger URL.
6. Save the webhook.

### Example payload

Use paths like `payload.payload.deployment.state`, `payload.payload.deployment.error`, `payload.payload.project.name`.

```json
{
  "id": "deployment_123",
  "type": "deployment",
  "payload": {
    "deployment": {
      "id": "dpl_abc123",
      "url": "https://my-app.vercel.app",
      "state": "ERROR",
      "error": "Build failed: npm install error"
    },
    "project": {
      "name": "my-app"
    }
  }
}
```

---

## GitHub

**Use case:** Trigger Devin on repository events (issues, pull requests, pushes, workflow runs).

### Setup

1. Go to your GitHub **Repository** → **Settings** → **Webhooks**.
2. Click **Add webhook**.
3. **Payload URL:** your Relay trigger URL.
4. **Content type:** `application/json`.
5. Choose events (e.g. **Issues**, **Pull requests**, **Pushes**, **Workflow runs**).
6. Save the webhook.

### Example payload (issue opened)

Use paths like `payload.action`, `payload.issue.title`, `payload.issue.body`, `payload.repository.full_name`.

```json
{
  "action": "opened",
  "issue": {
    "number": 42,
    "title": "Bug: Login page not loading",
    "body": "Users report the login page hangs",
    "state": "open"
  },
  "repository": {
    "name": "my-app",
    "full_name": "org/my-app"
  }
}
```

---

## Custom service

**Use case:** Any tool that can send HTTP POST with JSON.

### Setup

1. Configure your service to send **POST** requests.
2. Set **Content-Type** header to `application/json`.
3. Use your Relay trigger URL as the endpoint.
4. Send a JSON body. Structure it so you can reference fields in conditions and templates (e.g. `payload.message`, `payload.action`).

### Example payload

```json
{
  "message": "Deploy failed on production",
  "error_count": 3,
  "action": "deploy_failed",
  "repository": {
    "name": "my-app",
    "branch": "main"
  }
}
```

## Using payload paths

In **conditions** (Advanced settings) and **prompt templates**, use dot notation to reference the JSON payload:

- `payload.event.message` — nested field
- `payload.repository.name` — repository name
- `payload.action` — top-level field

Templates support variable substitution (e.g. Mustache-style `{{payload.event.message}}`). The rendered prompt is visible on each execution detail page.

## Testing before going live

Use the [Production Signals Library](https://devin-relay-testing.vercel.app) to fire mock events that match these shapes, or use the **Test webhook** block on the trigger detail page. See [Production Signals Library](/docs/guides/production-signals-library) and [Triggers](/docs/concepts/triggers).
