Relay v0.3.0 enhances trigger management with native GitHub repository integration.

### Features

- **GitHub repository input** — Associate each trigger with a specific GitHub repository directly in the trigger form and wizard
- **Path policies** — Configure include/exclude paths to scope when a trigger fires (e.g., only `src/`, exclude `node_modules/`)
- **Repo tree picker** — Visual dialog to browse and select repository paths for include/exclude rules
- **Devin prompt preview** — Preview how your template renders before saving
- **Webhook status polling** — Refined polling and guidance messages for clearer setup feedback
- **Layout improvements** — Trigger pages, execution views, and project layout reorganized for consistency

### Technical

- New Drizzle migrations for trigger path and repository metadata
- GitHub actions for repository and tree access
- Context builder and template engine updated to use repository scope
