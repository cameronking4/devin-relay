Relay v0.4.1 focuses on resource efficiency—reducing CPU usage across polling, worker concurrency, and low-noise retry paths.

### Improvements

- **Progressive polling backoff** — Session polling starts at 5 s and ramps to 30 s based on elapsed time, replacing the fixed 2 s interval
- **Exponential error backoff** — Consecutive poll failures now use capped exponential backoff instead of linear delays
- **Rate-limited workers** — Worker concurrency reduced from 5 to 3 with a 10-per-minute rate limiter to prevent burst CPU spikes
- **Bounded low-noise retries** — Low-noise mode retries use exponential backoff (30 s base, 5 min cap) and stop after 10 attempts, recording a failure instead of retrying indefinitely

### Technical

- `devin-adapter` polling loop tracks elapsed time instead of attempt count, with dynamic interval scaling
- `processor` accepts a `retryCount` parameter; exceeding the retry limit writes a failed execution record
- `queue` worker options updated with `limiter` configuration and new `retryCount` field on `ExecutionJobData`
- Worker script forwards `retryCount` from job data to the processor
